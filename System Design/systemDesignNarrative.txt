✅ The Golden System Design Narrative (3-Minute Version)

(You can adapt this to almost ANY system: Uber, Netflix, trading system, social feed, etc.)

🟢 1️⃣ Start With Request Flow (Bucket 1)

When a client application such as a web or mobile app makes a request, the domain is resolved through DNS to an IP address, typically pointing to a CDN or edge layer. The request travels over HTTPS and may be served directly from edge caches if the content is static; otherwise it is forwarded to the origin infrastructure.

💡 Signals you understand networking + latency early.

🟢 2️⃣ Edge Protection & Traffic Control (Bucket 5 intro)

At the edge, systems commonly enforce protections such as rate limiting, authentication checks, and WAF filtering to prevent abuse and ensure downstream services are not overwhelmed.

💡 Shows production thinking immediately.

🟢 3️⃣ Load Balancing & Horizontal Scale (Bucket 4)

The request reaches a reverse proxy or load balancer, which performs TLS termination and distributes traffic across horizontally scaled application instances to improve availability and throughput.

🟢 4️⃣ Application Layer & APIs (Bucket 2)

Inside the application layer, API routing directs requests to controllers where authentication, validation, and business logic execution occur through service components.

🟢 5️⃣ Modern Deployment Model (Bucket 5)

In modern architectures, these services run inside containers orchestrated by platforms like Kubernetes, allowing independent scaling, health management, and efficient resource utilization.

🟢 6️⃣ Performance Optimization (Bucket 4)

Before querying persistent storage, applications typically check an in-memory cache such as Redis using cache-aside patterns to reduce latency and database load.

🟢 7️⃣ Data Layer Decisions (Bucket 3)

The data layer may combine SQL databases for strongly consistent transactional workloads and NoSQL systems for high-throughput distributed data, with replication and sharding used to scale reads and writes.

🟢 8️⃣ Distributed System Reality (Bucket 5)

Because distributed systems must tolerate network failures, many large-scale platforms prioritize availability and rely on eventual consistency, propagating changes asynchronously across services.

🟢 9️⃣ Asynchronous Processing (Bucket 5)

For long-running or high-volume operations, services publish events to message queues, allowing background workers to process tasks reliably with retries and idempotent handling.

🟢 🔟 Response Path + System Goal

Finally, responses flow back through the same layers, with caching and CDN storage reducing future latency. Together, load balancing, caching, asynchronous processing, and rate limiting ensure the system remains scalable, resilient, and performant under heavy traffic.



✅ The 60-Second System Design Narrative

"When a client application makes a request, DNS resolves the domain to an edge location such as a CDN, where cached content may be served directly; otherwise the HTTPS request is forwarded to origin infrastructure. At the edge and gateway layers, protections like authentication and rate limiting help prevent abuse and protect downstream capacity. The request then reaches a load balancer, which distributes traffic across horizontally scaled application instances running in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes for reliability and auto-scaling. Inside the application layer, API routing and business logic execute, typically checking an in-memory cache like Redis before accessing the database to reduce latency. The data layer may combine SQL systems for strongly consistent transactions and NoSQL stores for high-throughput distributed workloads, using replication and sharding for scalability. Because distributed systems must tolerate failures, many operations are handled asynchronously through message queues, allowing worker services to process tasks reliably with retries and eventual consistency. Together, caching, load balancing, container orchestration, and rate limiting ensure the system maintains high throughput, low latency, and resilience under large-scale traffic."
