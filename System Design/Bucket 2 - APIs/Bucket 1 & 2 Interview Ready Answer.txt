“In a typical web system, the client sends an HTTP request to a server using a domain name, which is first resolved to an IP address through DNS. The request then travels over the internet and reaches a reverse proxy over HTTPS, where TLS terminates, the server identity is verified, and traffic is routed or load-balanced. The reverse proxy forwards the request to an application server, which exposes a REST API. The API is resource-based and stateless, with each endpoint defined by a URL and an HTTP method such as GET or POST. The API router maps the request to a controller, which validates the request and handles authentication, and then delegates to a service layer that applies business logic and interacts with the database if needed. Finally, the server returns a response with an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON representation of the resource, which travels back to the client over the same connection.”
