2.1 APIs (Interview Version)

“An API is an interface and contract between a client and a server that defines how the client can request data or trigger actions.
The client makes a request by calling a specific endpoint using an HTTP method, along with headers and sometimes a request body. 
Each endpoint represents a specific resource or service, such as users, orders, or locations.

Based on the method, endpoint, headers, and any parameters provided, the server routes the request to the appropriate backend service, 
performs the required logic, and returns a response with a status code and structured data, typically in JSON format.”

2.2 REST APIs (Interview Version)

“REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is a design style for building APIs over HTTP. 
In REST, systems are modeled around resources such as users, orders, or locations, each identified by a URL. 
Clients interact with these resources using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, which map to CRUD operations, 
and receive structured responses, typically in JSON.”

“REST APIs are stateless, meaning the server does not store client session state between requests. 
Each request includes all required information, such as authentication tokens. An endpoint is defined by the combination of an HTTP method and a URL, 
and it acts as the entry point to backend logic, routing the request to the appropriate service, which performs business logic 
and returns a response with an HTTP status code.”

2.3 HTTP Methods (Interview Version)

“In REST APIs, the HTTP method defines the action performed on a resource, while the URL identifies the resource itself. 
GET is used to retrieve data and does not modify server state. POST is used to create new resources and is not idempotent. 
PUT is used to replace an entire resource and is idempotent, while PATCH is used to partially update a resource. 
DELETE is used to remove a resource and is also idempotent.

These methods follow consistent semantics across REST APIs, which makes systems predictable, scalable, and easier to reason about.”

2.4 HTTP Codes:

+-------------+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Status Code | Name                 | What it Means (Interview Friendly)                   | Common When Used                            |
+-------------+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| 200         | OK                   | Request succeeded and response contains data.        | Successful GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE          |
| 201         | Created              | New resource was created successfully.               | Successful POST create                      |
| 202         | Accepted             | Request accepted; processing will happen async.      | Queued jobs, background processing          |
| 204         | No Content           | Request succeeded, but nothing to return in body.    | Successful DELETE or update with no payload |
| 301         | Moved Permanently    | Resource URL has permanently changed.                | URL/domain migration                        |
| 304         | Not Modified         | Client cache is still valid; no new content needed.  | Conditional GET with ETag/Last-Modified     |
| 400         | Bad Request          | Request is malformed or invalid.                     | Missing fields, invalid JSON/params         |
| 401         | Unauthorized         | Authentication is required or token is invalid.      | Missing/expired JWT or API key              |
| 403         | Forbidden            | Authenticated, but not allowed to access resource.   | Role/permission denied                      |
| 404         | Not Found            | Requested resource does not exist.                   | Wrong URL or missing entity ID              |
| 409         | Conflict             | Request conflicts with current resource state.       | Duplicate create, version conflict          |
| 422         | Unprocessable Entity | Syntax is valid, but business validation failed.     | Email format/business-rule validation fail  |
| 429         | Too Many Requests    | Client exceeded allowed request rate.                | Rate limiting/throttling                    |
| 500         | Internal Server Error| Server failed unexpectedly while handling request.   | Unhandled exceptions                        |
| 502         | Bad Gateway          | Upstream service returned invalid response.          | Reverse proxy/API gateway upstream issues   |
| 503         | Service Unavailable  | Service is temporarily unavailable.                  | Maintenance, overload, dependency outage    |
| 504         | Gateway Timeout      | Upstream service took too long to respond.           | Timeout between gateway and backend         |
+-------------+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

2.5 Idempotency (Interview Version)

“Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times results in the same server state. 
In REST, GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent, while POST is not. 
Idempotency is important for handling retries and failures safely in distributed systems.”
