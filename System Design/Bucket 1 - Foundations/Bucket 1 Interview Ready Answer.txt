“In a typical client–server system, a user action in the browser or app results in a request being sent to a server using a domain name. 
That domain is first resolved to an IP address through DNS, which is a distributed and cached system. 
The request then travels across the internet through multiple network hops and reaches the server-side reverse proxy over HTTPS. 
At the reverse proxy, TLS terminates, the server’s identity is verified using certificates, and the encrypted request is routed or load-balanced 
to the appropriate application server. The application server executes business logic and interacts with the database as needed, 
and the response then flows back through the reverse proxy to the client over the same connection, without repeating DNS resolution.”
