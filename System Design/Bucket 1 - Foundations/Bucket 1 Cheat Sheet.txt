Bucket 1 - One-Page Cheat Sheet (Interview + Revision)

1. Client-Server Architecture

  - Client handles UI and user interaction
  - Server handles business logic, security, shared data
  - Centralization enables trust, consistency, and scalability

  Interview line:
  | Client sends requests; server processes and responds,
  | acting as the trusted source of truth.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. IP Addresses and Ports

  - IP -> identifies which machine
  - Port -> identifies which service on that machine
  - One machine can run many services via different ports

  Interview line:
  | IP selects the machine; port selects the service on that machine.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. DNS (Domain Name System)

  - Converts domain names -> IP addresses
  - Lookup order:
    1) Browser cache
    2) OS cache
    3) Local network
    4) ISP / recursive resolver
    5) Root DNS
    6) TLD DNS (Top-Level Domain)
    7) Authoritative DNS (source of truth)
  - Important: DNS returns IP only, never ports

  Interview line:
  | DNS is a distributed, cached system that maps domain names to IP addresses.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. HTTP vs HTTPS (+ TLS)

  - HTTP -> plaintext, no identity verification
  - HTTPS -> HTTP over TLS
  - TLS provides:
    - Encryption
    - Integrity
    - Server authentication (via certificates)
  - TLS happens before HTTP data is sent

  Interview line:
  | HTTPS uses TLS to verify server identity and encrypt traffic
  | before any HTTP request is exchanged.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy

  - Forward Proxy:
    - Client-side
    - Acts on behalf of client
    - Hides client identity
    - Holds access rules, logs, cache

  - Reverse Proxy:
    - Server-side
    - Single public entry point
    - Hides backend servers
    - Handles TLS, routing, load balancing, security

  - Application Servers:
    - Hold business logic and data
    - Talk to databases
    - Do not manage traffic concerns

  Interview line:
  | Forward proxies represent clients, reverse proxies represent servers,
  | and application servers own business logic and data.

----------------------------------------------------------------

6. Latency

  - Latency = total time for request -> response
  - Accumulates across:
    - DNS
    - Network hops
    - TLS handshake
    - Reverse proxy routing
    - App server processing
    - Database queries
  - Lower latency -> better UX
  - Reduced by:
    - Fewer hops
    - Caching
    - Geo-distribution
    - Connection reuse

  Interview line:
  | Latency is the sum of delays across the entire request path,
  | and good system design minimizes it at each stage.
